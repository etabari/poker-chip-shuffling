## Pot Odds

Pot Odds is how much you should pay to see the next card. If thereâ€™s 200
in the pot, and enemy bets 100, you have to call 100 to win 300, which
gives you the pot-odds of 3:1 or the probability of 1/4=25%.

So Pot odds probability is calculated as `bet / (pot + 2 * bet)`:

``` r
data[, pot_odds := bet / (pot + 2 * bet)]

ggplot(data, aes(bet, pot_odds, color=factor(pot))) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_few() +
  scale_color_few(name='Pot Size') +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(size=.05)) +
  labs(x='Bet Size', y='Pot Odds')
```

you can see that the pot-odds are dependant to bet size and pot size,
but their are independant of the portion of the pot is being betted:

  theme(panel.grid = element_line(size=.05)) +
  labs(x='Bet / Pot Size', y='Pot Odds')
```

That means:

- a bet of 1/3 of the pot, always give you a pot odds of
16%.
- a bet of 1/2 of the pot, always give you a pot odds of 25%.
- a pot size bet, always give you a pot odds of 33%.
- double the pot size, pushes the pot odds to 40%
- ...

## When should you call

You should call when your chances of winning is more than your pot odds.

For instance if:

- you hold an Ace, Queen
- your opponent has King Queen
- Flop is K 2 7

you only win with an Ace, which there are only 3 left *out* in the deck.

your chances of getting an Ace is 3 / 47 (\~6%) in turn and 3 / 46
(\~6%) in river.

For fast calculations people do `outs * 4` (on the turn, and `outs * 2`
on the river) which will give you 12% in this case.

You should only call if your chances of winning is **more** than the pot
odds.

## Minimum outs

The best strategy is to know what is the minumum *outs* you should have
to call a bet!

On Turn:

`outs / 47 + outs / 46 > Pot Odds`

which leads to

`outs > Pot Odds / (1/46 + 1/47)`

``` r
data[, min_outs := ceiling(pot_odds / (1/46 + 1/47))]


ggplot(data, aes(bet/pot, min_outs, color=factor(pot))) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_few() +
  scale_color_few(name='Pot Size') +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(size=.05)) +
  labs(x='Bet / Pot Size', y='Min Outs')
```

That means 

- to call a half pot size bet, you must at least have 6 outs.
- to call a pot size bet, you must have a 8 outs or more.

For out example case when you have 3 outs (3 remaining Aces), you can
only call if the bet size is less than 15% of the potsize


``` r
data[min_outs==3, scales::percent(bet/pot)]
```

 "15.0%"
